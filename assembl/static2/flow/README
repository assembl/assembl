The graphql_types.flow.js was generated with the following commands:

    assembl-pshell local.ini
    from assembl.graphql.schema import generate_schema_json; generate_schema_json()
    ctr+d
    cd assembl/static2
    yarn add apollo-codegen@0.19.1
    ./node_modules/.bin/apollo-codegen generate js/app/graphql/*.graphql js/app/graphql/fragments/*.graphql js/app/graphql/mutations/*.graphql --schema /tmp/schema.json --target flow --output flow/graphql_types.flow.js
    ./node_modules/.bin/prettier-eslint --write flow/graphql_types.flow.js
    git checkout package.json yarn.lock
    rm -rf node_modules/
    yarn

Note that dependencies of apollo-codegen conflict with our current package versions, hence the ungainly yarn maneuver.
